module enchant is part of package pyenchant

BUT THERE IS ONE BIG PROBLEM. 

For some reason, neither conda nor pip will help install the package pyenchant. 
Also there is no support for this package. Having researched all the forums, there was one link that helped.

The problem is PyEnchant does not work with Python 64bit. "Downgrading" to 32bit resolved the issue.

The command to install Pyenchant is as follows

>pip install pyenchant
